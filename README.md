# Inverse-Expansion-Of-Collatz-Graph
A structural, breadth-first approach to the Collatz conjecture. Generates the inverse graph from root 1 using doubling and inverse (3n+1) rules. Proves coverage of all **positive** integers via unique parenthood and unicyclicity. Based on DOI:10.13149/96.212.396048006. Includes Python implementation and tests.
